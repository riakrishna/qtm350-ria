##DATA ANALYSIS
# QTM 350 - Quiz 01

## Instructions

Please complete the following tasks using command-line operations and Git
commands as covered in Lectures 02 to 06. Document all commands in a file named
`commands.txt` located in the repository's root directory. The final repository
on GitHub should reflect all changes made, and the `commands.txt` file should
contain a comprehensive list of all commands used throughout the project. You
may copy and paste the commands directly into the `commands.txt` file if
needed.

Please submit the link to your repository on Canvas or via email at
<danilo.freire@emory.edu>.
